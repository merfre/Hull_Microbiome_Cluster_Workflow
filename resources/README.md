This folder is meant to contain all resources necessary for running the workflow, for example reference sequences or databases.

Wherever feasible, they can also be downloaded programmatically via rules defined in the pipeline.
Please create a directory, or multiple directories, here for your library, or libraries, that contains your raw fastq files. This directory should be labeled as the title for your run and contain the outputs from Guppy basecalling (i.e. directories of barcodes containing raw fastq files).

Each database should be added to its respective folder in the database directory.
