### Configuration file for the Hull Microbiome Cluster Workflow ###

conda_envs: "workflow/envs/environment.yaml"

input_directory: "resources/"

metadata_file: "config/metadata_example.txt" # example: "config/metadata_example.txt"

### Analysis options ###

## Contig assembly and assessment
# indicate with True/False whether to assemble with metaflye
include_assembly: False

## Host contamination removal
# indicate with True/False whether to include removal of host sequences with minimap2
include_host_removal: False

### Database locations ###
# Place your reference databases in these locations or edit to specify the location

kraken_db: "resources/databases/kraken2_std_database"

filtering_reference: "resources/databases/host_reference/"

### Parameters ###

# For fastp
qualified_quality_phred: "7" # quality value that a base is qualified - Default 15 means phred quality >=Q15 is qualified.
unqualified_percent_limit: "40" # how many percents of bases are allowed to be unqualified (0~100) - Default 40 means 40%
average_qual: "0" # if one read's average quality score <avg_qual, then this read/pair is discarded - Default 0 means no requirement (int [=0])
min_length: "200" # minimum length requirement
front_trim: "0" # number of bases to trim off the front of the read
tail_trim: "0" # number of bases to trim off the tail of the read

# For metaflye
read_type: "--nano-raw"
# --nano-corr: is ONT reads that were corrected with other methods (<3% error)
# --nano-raw: ONT regular reads, pre-Guppy5 (<20% error)
minimum_overlap: "1000"
# minimum overlap length for two reads to be considered overlapping, Typical value is 3k-10k (and down to 1k for datasets with shorter read length)

# For kraken2
kraken_confidence: "0.1" #specify a threshold score in the [0,1] interval;
# classifier then will adjust labels up the tree until the label's score (described below) meets or exceeds that threshold
